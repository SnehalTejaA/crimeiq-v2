## What This Does

CrimeIQ is a Streamlit web application that wraps the Phase 3 analytical work
(VIF selection, Random Forest, SHAP, K-Means) in a live, interactive interface.

### 4 Pillars

| Tab | What it shows |
|-----|--------------|
| 🗺️ Crime Heatmap | Folium choropleth of NC crime rates by county, filterable by year |
| 🎛️ What-If Simulator | Sliders for every feature → live predicted crime rate + SHAP waterfall |
| 🤖 AI Policy Advisor | Claude API generates evidence-based policy recommendations from SHAP drivers |
| 📊 Analytics Dashboard | Trend charts, feature importance, SHAP summary, model performance |

## Setup

### 1. Clone / download
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SnehalTejaA/crimeiq.git
cd crimeiq
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the app
```
streamlit run app.py
```

The app loads data directly from GitHub on first run (cached after that).

## Dataset

**Cornwell & Trumbull NC County Crime Dataset (1981–1987)**
- 630 observations · 90 counties · 7 years
- Source: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/nishapattim05-del/crime-project-data)

**14 VIF-selected features used (all VIF < 10):**
`prbarr`, `prbconv`, `prbpris`, `avgsen`, `polpc`, `density`, `taxpc`,
`west`, `central`, `urban`, `pctmin80`, `wcon`, `wtuc`, `wfed`

**Target variable:** `crmrte` (crimes per person)

---

## Model

The Random Forest Regressor is trained fresh on app startup (cached via
`@st.cache_resource`). Performance mirrors Phase 3 findings:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| R²     | ~0.905 |
| RMSE   | ~0.000178 |

---

## AI Policy Advisor

The policy recommendation engine sends the SHAP feature drivers for the
current What-If profile to the Claude Sonnet API and receives a structured
policy brief with:

1. Situation summary
2. Top 3 actionable policy recommendations (tied to SHAP drivers)
3. Risk factors to monitor
4. One honest data limitation
