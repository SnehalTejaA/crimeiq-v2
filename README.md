## What This Does

CrimeIQ integrates Phase 3 analytical work with Phase 4 real-world deployment features including scenario simulation, research alignment validation, and a bias & fairness audit.

### 7 Pillars

| Tab | What it shows |
|-----|--------------|
| 🗺️ Crime Heatmap | Folium choropleth of NC crime rates by county, filterable by year |
| 🎛️ What-If Simulator | Sliders for every feature → live predicted crime rate + SHAP waterfall |
| 🤖 AI Policy Advisor | Claude API (Anthropic) generates evidence-based policy recommendations from SHAP drivers |
| 📊 Analytics Dashboard | Trend charts, feature importance, SHAP summary, model performance |
| 🎭 Scenario Simulation | Preset scenarios simulating systemic socioeconomic or law enforcement shifts |
| 🔬 Research Alignment | Validates feature selection against established criminology theory |
| ⚖️ Bias & Fairness Audit | Analyzes predictive fairness across key demographic sub-groups |

## Setup

### 1. Clone / download
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SnehalTejaA/crimeiq-v2.git
cd crimeiq
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app loads data directly from GitHub on first run (cached after that).

## Dataset

**Cornwell & Trumbull NC County Crime Dataset (1981–1987)**
- 630 observations · 90 counties · 7 years
- Source: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/nishapattim05-del/crime-project-data)

**15 Features used (14 VIF-selected + Phase 4 extensions):**
`prbarr`, `prbconv`, `prbpris`, `avgsen`, `polpc`, `density`, `taxpc`,
`west`, `central`, `urban`, `pctmin80`, `wcon`, `wtuc`, `wfed`, `wage_gap_service_mfg`

**Target variable:** `crmrte` (crimes per person)

---

## Model

The Random Forest Regressor is trained fresh on app startup (cached via
`@st.cache_resource`). Performance mirrors Phase 3 findings:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| R²     | ~0.905 |
| RMSE   | ~0.000178 |

---

## Phase 4 Extensions

- **Scenario Simulation Engine:** Compares custom baseline feature inputs against 4 predefined systemic scenarios (or Natural Language defined scenarios).
- **Research Alignment:** Evaluates variables against Becker (1968) and Cornwell & Trumbull (1994) foundational principles of deterrence and economic opportunity.
- **Bias & Fairness Audit:** Evaluates predictive differences across 4 subgroups (e.g. Urban vs Rural, High vs Low Minority).
- **Model Drift Monitor:** Computes and visualizes out-of-distribution shifts between continuous feature vectors using Mean Absolute Difference.
- **AI Agent Pipeline:** A unified backend python wrapper that intercepts user queries, detects the requisite scenario automatically, simulates it against the Random Forest, and returns the unified response dictionary.

## API Deployment Concept

POST `/predict`
Input:  `{ "prbarr": 0.3, "polpc": 0.002, ... all 14 features }`
Output: `{ "predicted_crime_rate": 0.032 }`

POST `/simulate`
Input:  `{ "scenario": "High Policing", "features": {...} }`
Output: `{ "baseline": 0.031, "scenario": 0.028, "delta_pct": -9.7 }`

POST `/agent`
Input:  `{ "query": "what if police presence decreases?", "features": {...} }`
Output: `{ "scenario_detected": "Police Reduction", "predicted_crime_rate": 0.034 }`

## Production Readiness

The model supports two deployment modes:

**1. Batch Processing**
The system can run periodically (daily or weekly) to generate crime
predictions for all counties and support long-term planning. Outputs
are stored and used for trend analysis and resource allocation across
law enforcement agencies.

**2. Real-Time Prediction**
The model is integrated into an API where users provide inputs such
as police levels or economic conditions and receive instant
predictions. This supports operational decision-making and live
scenario simulation through the CrimeIQ interface.

This flexibility allows the model to support both strategic planning
and real-time decision-making. The model achieved R²≈0.905,
indicating strong predictive performance. To ensure long-term
reliability, data drift detection is built in (Tab 4 — Analytics
Dashboard) to identify changes in input distributions over time.
If performance degrades, the model can be retrained with updated
data.
